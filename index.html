  <h2>Aspiring Jr. Web Developer</h2>

  <p>My name is Henok Debesay. I am a Year Up student. Year Up is an intensive, one-year program for students combining hands-on skill development and internships at some of Americaâ€™s top companies. I am currently studying front-end development. I am a lifelong learner and love challenges. My hobbies include playing soccer, watching movies, and hanging out with friends and family. I am working hard to land an internship at a startup or at any MANGA companies in the next six months.
